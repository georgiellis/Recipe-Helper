# Recipe-Helper
​
## Description 
​
Project #1 creating a responsive portfolio. This group project required us to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.
​
A recipe finder that uses ingredients to search for recipesm  using the following guidlines:
​
    * Must use at least two server-side APIs
​
    * Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
​
    * Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
​
    * Use at least one new third-party API
​
    * Must have a polished UI
​
    * Must meet good quality coding standards
​
    * Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into modals)
​
    * Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
​
